# DiffusionModels


Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) are a kind of generative model that can create new data, like images or audio. They work by taking an existing piece #of data and slowly adding noise to it, step by step. Then, the model is trained to reverse this process, taking the noisy data and returning the original clean data.# By learning to remove noise, DDPMs can also learn the underlying patterns in the data, allowing them to generate entirely new but realistic samples.
